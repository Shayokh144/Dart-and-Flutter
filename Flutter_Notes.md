# Flutter

## Introduction

- As a cross-platform framework, Flutter most closely resembles React Native. Both allow for a reactive and declarative style of programming. Unlike React Native, however, Flutter doesnâ€™t need to use a JavaScript bridge, which improves app startup times and overall performance. Dart achieves this by using **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT)** compilation.

- Dart can also use `Just-In-Time (JIT)` compilation. JIT compilation with Flutter improves the development workflow by allowing a `hot reload` capability to refresh the UI during development without the need for an entirely new build.
